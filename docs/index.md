# Overview

Welcome to the Inkomoko Integration Pipeline.

This project is a scalable, observable, and reliable integration between:

- Java/Spring Boot producers (CRM, Inventory)
- Kafka (broker + UI)
- Python async consumer (Analytics pipeline)
- Redis for idempotency

## Whatâ€™s Implemented

- Producers poll CRM/Inventory and publish to Kafka.
- Consumer merges, dedupes, and delivers to Analytics (JSON or CSV batching).
- DLQ on downstream failures.
- Metrics exported for producers, consumer, and mock APIs.
- Provisioned Grafana dashboard and alerting (configure webhook URL in provisioning to receive alerts).
